Core design tokens package for the LG UI Kit design system.

## Overview

This package provides the foundational, primitive design tokens used across the `enovaui` ecosystem. These tokens serve as the building blocks for all visual attributes in the LG UI Kit.

### What are Primitive Tokens?

Primitive tokens represent the most basic visual values in our design system:

* **Colors**: Base color palette
* **Typography**: Font sizes, weights, and line heights
* **Spacing**: Standard spacing and layout measurements
* **Radius**: Border radius values for consistent component shapes

## Installation

To install the package, use your preferred package manager:

```bash
npm install @enovaui/core-tokens
```

or

```bash
yarn add @enovaui/core-tokens
```

### Token Structure

The tokens are organized in the following categories:

* `color-primitive`: Base color values including:
  - Gray scales (neutral, mist, cool, blue, warm)
  - Brand colors (active red)
  - Accent colors (orange, yellow, green, blue variants)
  - Each color has a range from 5 to 99 for precise theming control
* `typography-primitive`: Typography-related values including:
  - Font sizes from 10px to 180px
  - Font weights from thin (100) to black (900)
* `spacing-primitive`: Spacing and sizing values from 2px to 156px for consistent layouts
* `radius-primitive`: Border radius values from 0 to 999px for component shapes
